# City of Boston: Transit and Performance - Team C

## Description
This project delves into an in-depth analysis of MBTA bus routes in Boston to assess their performance concerning the socioeconomic demographics of the communities they serve. The aim is to identify potential disparities in service quality and accessibility. By examining operational data alongside census demographic information, this project seeks to uncover any correlations between service levels and the demographics of served neighborhoods.

## Goals
- Analyze MBTA bus routes' performance in relation to demographic data of Boston neighborhoods
- Investigate disparities in travel times, on-time performance, and reliability across different bus routes
- Examine the racial, economic, and age demographics of communities primarily served by each bus route
- Assess whether service disparities disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities.

## Methodology
- Data collection from MBTA APIs and census demographics.
- Cleaning, joining, and filtering datasets for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis, statistical summaries, and visualization techniques.
- Geographic mapping of the data to identify spatial patterns.
- Utilization of data science techniques to assess service disparities.

## Key Questions Explored
1. What are the end-to-end travel times for different bus routes across Boston?
2. Are there notable differences in on-time performance and reliability among routes?
3. What are the racial, economic, and age demographics of communities served by each bus route?
4. Do identified service disparities disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities?

## Conclusion
This data-driven analysis aims to promote discussion and progress towards establishing an affordable, reliable transportation network that serves all communities equitably in Boston.

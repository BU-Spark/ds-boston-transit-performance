SCRUM REPORT 11/30
BOSTON TRANSIT PERFORMANCE TEAM B

WHAT HAVE WE WORKED ON?
We have started our extension project â€” we made a list of questions we want to answer and have started aggregating and cleaning data for that.
We have created a system for calculating a custom accessibility score for stations and are working on connection that score to neighborhood census data.

WHAT WILL WE BE WORKING ON NEXT?
We will be analyzing accessibility scores of stations and connecting that to census data. We want to use an ML model for this.
We will also be drawing conclusions about likely future improvements on station accessibility. Kevin and Suin will be working on aggregating census
data and finding trends between station accessbility and demographic data, while Vishva, Yu and Yufeng will be focused calculating and cleaning
the accessibility data and making sure we have consistent information.

HAVE WE RUN INTO ANY ISSUES? DO WE NEED HELP?
We are having trouble figuring out how to use an ML model to answer any of our questions. We only have accessibility data from 2 consecutive years,
which doesn't allow for linear regression (which would require at least 7-10 years of accessibility history) so we're working on figuring out another
way to integrate ML into our project. We asked for help during lab but still are struggling to figure out how to integrate ML.

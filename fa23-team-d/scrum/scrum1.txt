What have I worked on?
We are currently looking at the data provided in the project documentation and beginning preliminary data processing procedures. No major progress points because it was a long weekend + midterms.

What will I be working on next?
Once we finish getting everyone onboard, we will be meeting and identifying which portions of data will be needed to answer the basic questions. 

Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?
No issues yet, just need to hit the ground running. 

Team Lead: Have I talked to the TPM  recently? When are we meeting with them next?
Yes, weekly labs on Thursday.

## Description
Problem Statement

Public transportation is a pivotal element in shaping the daily experiences and quality of life for residents across Massachusetts and the Greater Boston area. Yet, the assurance of equal and fair access to quality service across all reachable areas remains a question that demands investigation. Given its profound impact on the day-to-day lives of residents, it becomes imperative to quantify the equity and fairness embedded in Boston's public transportation system and to discern the varying perceptions of service quality among different neighborhoods.
Our analysis leverages a combination of data science methodologies, encompassing the extraction and examination of public transportation data, and demographic information. We explored key questions such as: How does the quality of public transportation services vary across different neighborhoods? Are there discernible disparities in service frequency, reliability, and accessibility? How do factors such as income levels, population density, and geographic location correlate with the perceived quality of public transportation?
Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the existing state of public transportation equity. The goal is to pinpoint areas where improvements can be made, ensuring that the benefits of an efficient and reliable transportation network are shared equitably among diverse communities.

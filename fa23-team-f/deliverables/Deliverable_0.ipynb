        "  This project is to develop a data driven report based on an analysis of MBTA bus data. We are going to analyze service performance trends by geography based on metrics like end-to-end travel times, service levels of different routes, and population sizes and characteristics served by different bus routes.\n",

        "predictions(predicted arrival/departure times), routes, schedules, scheduled arrival/departure times, shapes(stops and maps for branches, including route variations), stops, trips, vehicles(vehicle positions). Also the census data for the areas serviced by each bus route.\n",

        "  Some of the bus routes are not properly tracked so it may be difficult for us to track on the transportation performance. The demographic data of different zones served by the bus lines may not be accurate since it's from 2020. Also, we may not have the historical real-time data record from MBTA for its bus routes.\n",

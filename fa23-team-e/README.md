## Project Summary

This project analyzed MBTA bus data to uncover service performance trends and disparities across neighborhoods. Focusing on economic development, environmental sustainability, and equity, the analysis examined travel times, delay patterns, and demographic characteristics of communities served by different bus routes. The project's in-depth exploration delved into seasonal variations, rush hours, holidays, and weather impacts on bus delays. By integrating various datasets and visualizations, the study provided insights crucial for enhancing public transportation, addressing disparities, and informing urban planning strategies to optimize bus allocation and improve overall transit efficiency in Boston.
